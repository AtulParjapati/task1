                <h2>Father of Nation</h2>
                <p>
                    Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, he became a global symbol of nonviolence and peace. Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or Ahimsa, was central to his approach in combating social and political injustices. He played a crucial role in India’s struggle for independence from British rule, leading major movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, the Civil Disobedience Movement, and the Quit India Movement. One of his most iconic protests was the Dandi March in 1930, where he marched 240 miles to challenge the British monopoly on salt, inspiring millions to join the cause.
